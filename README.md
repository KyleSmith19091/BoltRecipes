# BoltRecipes
Bolt recipes is an app that I created for my final Year 12 IT project. This project had to be fully documented
with a spec, design and test document. This project is in the form of an android application, I did not add the android's
boiler plate code to keep the repository clean for reference by others.

## What did I learn
- Base64 character encoding, which I used for storing user passwords
- Creating a SQL database on the device
- Nested classes
- Asynchronous calls
- Android intents
